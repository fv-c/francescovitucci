    My talk at the conference ‘Music. From Pythagoras to A.I.', held in Bari on 04-03-2025 at the Politecnico di Bari's ‘Museum of Photography’, ended with great enthusiasm! It was an incredible opportunity to share ideas, explore techniques and engage with a passionate community. My talk received great feedback, and discussing IHM and AI-assisted experimentation in such a stimulating context was a real pleasure.

    The third Issue of “Ex Chordis - A Bowed Strings Journal” is now online. “Ex Chordis” is edited by ‘Niccolò Piccinni’ Conservatory of Music, Bari, and published by Milano University Press. The aim is to create a shared hub to link research, education and music practice, from an interdisciplinary perspective. The third Issue (No. III - 2024), open access and peer-reviewed, provides papers on major topics in the field of performance practice, musicology, lutherie, music analysis, artistic research, digital technologies.

<p>
    I am glad to share that my essay, <strong>In Human Memories. Tecnica, creatività e autodeterminazione: una proposta etica</strong>, is part of the issue. This research rwork, developed by a team composed of Giuseppe Silvi, Francesco Abbrescia, Anthony Di Furia, Francesco Scagliola and myself, investigates the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in modern compositional practices, with a particular focus on my compositional work <em>In Human Memories</em> (2024).

    The proceedings for the International Csound Conference 2024 (ICSC 2024) have been officially published. This collection includes a diverse range of papers, presentations, and research contributions from leading composers, technologists, and sound artists engaged in the development and creative use of Csound.
</p>

<p>
    I am glad to share that my publication, <strong>Opening Mind by Opening Architecture: Analysis Strategies</strong>, is part of the proceedings. This paper, developed by a team composed of Giuseppe Silvi, Daniele Giuseppe Annese, Francesco Scagliola, Anthony Di Furia and myself, explores the construction of analytical tools that aim to create awareness in the DSP design. The full text of the paper can be downloaded from the following link:
